##  Strategic Recommendations

### Strategy 1: SHORT-SELL During Greed Periods
**When**: Fear & Greed Index > 55, maximize at > 75
**Expected Win Rate**: 42% (Greed) to 61.8% (Extreme Greed)
**Target**: $30-44 average PnL per trade
**Risk Management**: Stop loss above recent swing high + 2%

### Strategy 2: SCALP During Fear Periods
**When**: Index < 45 with volume spikes
**Holding Period**: 5-15 minute intraday trades
**Expected Win Rate**: 39-40%
**Volume Advantage**: 62,036 trades = multiple opportunities

### Strategy 3: SKIP Neutral Sentiment
**When**: Index stays 45-55 for 3+ consecutive days
**Action**: Close positions, don't enter new trades
**Benefit**: Avoid 67.3% of losing trades
**Expected Savings**: Preserve 2% capital vs forced trading

### Position Sizing Framework
Base Position = $X (your account risk per trade, 2% recommended)

EXTREME GREED (Index > 75):
Position Size = Base × 2.0 (MAXIMIZE - 61.8% win rate!)

GREED (Index 55-75):
Position Size = Base × 1.5 (Strong returns)

NEUTRAL (Index 45-55):
Position Size = Base × 0.0 (SKIP - lowest win rate)

FEAR (Index 25-45):
Position Size = Base × 0.75 (High volume, moderate quality)

EXTREME FEAR (Index < 25):
Position Size = Base × 0.5 (Opportunity but volatility)

##  Key Insights for Trading

### 1. Counterintuitive Strategy
Traditional wisdom: "Be greedy when others are fearful"
**Your Data Shows**: Sell during greed, scalp during fear

### 2. Sentiment-Aware Position Sizing
- Don't use fixed position sizes
- Scale based on sentiment state
- 2x during greed, 0.5x during fear

### 3. Directional Bias Matters
- Selling performs better than buying
- Most consistent profits from SHORT strategy
- Long trades underperform in this data

### 4. Avoid Neutral Markets
- Lowest win rate (32.7%)
- No clear trending opportunity
- Better to skip than force trades

### 5. Volume ≠ Profitability
- Fear has highest volume (62K trades)
- But lower average profit ($19.07)
- Quality > quantity in trading

##  Limitations & Caveats

- **Period-Specific**: Data from March 2023 - May 2025; patterns may change
- **Exchange-Specific**: Hyperliquid data only; may not generalize to other exchanges
- **Historical Performance**: Past results don't guarantee future performance
- **Leverage Risk**: Data includes leveraged positions; high risk activity
- **Execution Risk**: Assumes perfect execution; real slippage varies
- **Causation**: Sentiment and performance correlate; causation not proven
