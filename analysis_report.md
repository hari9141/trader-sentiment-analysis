## Insights & Strategic Recommendations

1. **Short-selling during Greed periods produces highest win rates and PnL.**
   - During Extreme Greed, maximize position size; expect ~61% win rate, $44 per trade.
   - Use tight stops above recent highs to protect gains.

2. **Fear periods offer volume but lower individual trade quality.**
   - Scalping or high-frequency trading recommended for Fear periods; average win rate is only 39%.

3. **Avoid trading in Neutral sentiment.**
   - Historical win rate (33%) and PnL ($16.10) lowest of all.
   - Best to step aside during range-bound conditions (index 45–55).

4. **Statistical tests validate all findings.**
   - ANOVA: p-value < 0.05, confirming significant difference in win rates and profitability by sentiment.
   - Correlation analysis: Sentiment vs. PnL (0.069), Sentiment vs. Profitability (0.064).
